# Tutorials

Here, we work through a series of tutorials that systematically introduce you to
Firedrake and the G-ADOPT library.

One the first tab, we include 5 tutorials from Firedrake.

1. The positive-definite Helmholtz equation.
2. Strong (Dirichlet) boundary conditions.
3. Linear elasticity.
4. A time-dependent problem using Burgers equation.
5. PDE constrained optimisation.

On the second tab, we include 2 tutorials that are specific to G-ADOPT.

1. Idealised 2-D mantle convection in a square box.
2. 2-D annulus case.

We will add to these tutorials over time.
