# Funding and Partners

## Background
G-ADOPT was initiated and funded within the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) [2020 platforms call](https://doi.org/10.47486/PL031), which invested in platforms that would transform the way research is conducted in various disciplines. G-ADOPT is short for ‘Geoscientific ADjoint Optimization PlaTform’. At first, though, the ‘G’ stood for ‘Geodynamic’ when the platform had a tighter focus. G-ADOPT is now applied across many branches of geosciences, including groundwater simulation, optimisation for renewable energy generation, and simulating the solid Earth's response to melting polar ice sheets. In 2023, the platform received funding from AuScope, to focus, in particular, on the latter challenge.

## Partners
The Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) is a transformational initiative that enables Australian research community and industry access to nationally significant, leading edge data intensive einfrastructure, platforms, skills and collections of high-quality data. In partnerships with organisations, the ARDC leads facilitations that work towards a coherent research environment to enable researchers to find, access, contribute to and effectively use services to maximise research quality and impact. The ARDC is funded by the Australian Government's National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).

The National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) is Australia’s leading high-performance data, storage and computing organisation, providing expert services to benefit all domains of science, government and industry. NCI brings the Australian Government and the Australian research sector together through a broad collaboration involving the largest national science agencies, universities, industry and the Australian Research Council. NCI is supported by the Australian Government's National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS)

The consequences of changes in the Antarctic, including sea-level rise, extreme weather events, alterations to rainfall patterns, and fisheries impacts, will be profoundly costly to Australia. However, the speed and scale of future change remains poorly understood. The Australian Centre of Excellence in Antarctic Sciences (ACEAS) will combine new field data with innovative models to revolutionise predictions of the future of the East Antarctic and Southern Ocean.
