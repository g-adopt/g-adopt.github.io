**Sydney, Earthbyte group — 28 March 2025**
Rhodri Davies and Sia Ghelichkhan visited the Earthbyte group at the University of
Sydney. They presented recent developments targetting global geodynamical models and
their interaction with plate-reconstruction frameworks, here via GPlates and its
PyGPlates Python interface. A particular focus of this workshop was model output, with
an emphasis on the tools available to post-process and interrogate global 3-D spherical
models.

**Paris, IPGP — 09 May 2025**
Thomas Duvernay visited IPGP and gave an overview of Firedrake and G-ADOPT to institute
members. The presentation included an introduction with hands-on examples of
Firedrake-based simulations alongside a discussion and overview of recent G-ADOPT
developments. The objective was to provide an as-complete-as-possible first look of
Firedrake and G-ADOPT to potential new users.
