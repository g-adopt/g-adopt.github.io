**Sydney, Earthbyte group — 28 March 2025**
Sydney workshop: Earthbyte generally very happy with the G-ADOPT side of things and
eager to collaborate more and more closely. They're going to add functionality to
pygplates to make that coupling even easier, and we will keep progressing with things at
our end. One aspect that we will need to think about soon is archiving our model output
on NCI so that others can access.
