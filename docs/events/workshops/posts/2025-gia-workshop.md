# GIA Workshop 2025 

The G-ADOPT team will be holding a workshop focused on Glacial Isostatic
Adjustment in Hobart, Tasmania on **Tuesday 04/11/25**. We welcome 
all participants, including existing and prospective users, developers,
and collaborators.

The schedule is TBC but we will likely cover how to set up and run G-ADOPT 
for GIA problems and give an introduction to transient rheology and 
adjoint-based inversions.

Note the workshop is the day before the ACEAS meeting in Hobart.
