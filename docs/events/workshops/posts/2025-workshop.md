# G-ADOPT Workshop 2025

The 2025 G-ADOPT workshop will be held at the
[ANU's Research School of Earth Sciences](https://earthsciences.anu.edu.au/) in
Canberra. Mark your diaries for **Tuesday 18/11/25 (9.15 am – 5.45 pm)**, with a workshop
dinner that evening. We welcome all participants, including existing and prospective
users, developers, and collaborators.

The workshop will provide an opportunity for the G-ADOPT team to showcase recent
development and advances in both the forward and adjoint components of this finite-element
modelling platform. Areas of focus will include the following topics, with the level of detail
and time dedicated to each tailored to the background and interests of registered participants.

1. Mantle and lithosphere dynamics;
2. Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and visco-elasticity;
3. Groundwater modelling;
4. New functionality.
