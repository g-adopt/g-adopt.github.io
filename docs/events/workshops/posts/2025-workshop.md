# G-ADOPT Workshop 2025

## [Register Here](https://payments.anu.edu.au/GADOPT2025)

The 2025 G-ADOPT workshop will be held at the
[ANU's Research School of Earth Sciences](https://earthsciences.anu.edu.au/) in
Canberra. Mark your diaries for **Tuesday 18/11/25 (9.30 am ‚Äì 5.30 pm)**, with a workshop
dinner that evening. We welcome all participants, including existing and prospective
users, developers, and collaborators.

The workshop will provide an opportunity for the G-ADOPT team to showcase recent
development and advances in both the forward and adjoint components of this finite-element
modelling platform. Areas of focus will include the following topics, with the level of detail
and time dedicated to each tailored to the background and interests of registered participants.

1. Mantle and lithosphere dynamics;
2. Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and visco-elasticity;
3. Groundwater modelling;
4. New functionality: (i) mesh adaptivity; (ii) multi-material simulations;

Thanks to generous support from our partners at [AuScope](https://www.auscope.org.au/),
this workshop will be free for all students, provided registration is completed before
the **early-bird registration deadline of 31/07/2025**. Student registrations after this
date require a contribution of A\$30. Registration for other participants will be A\$30
prior to the early-bird registration deadline and A\$60 thereafter.

### üß© Notes

- The **morning** session will feature short talks, demonstrations, and open discussion.
- In the **afternoon**, we‚Äôll switch to hands-on tutorials ‚Äî running in **parallel** for mantle/lithosphere dynamics and GIA ‚Äî before wrapping up with sessions on new functionality.
- Bring a **laptop** if you‚Äôd like to follow along with the practicals.
- Tutorials will be run on **[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)**, so please make sure you have a **Google account** set up beforehand.
- To visualise results, please **install [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/download/)** ahead of time.
