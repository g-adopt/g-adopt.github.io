# G-ADOPT Workshop 2025

The 2025 G-ADOPT workshop will be held at the
[ANU's Research School of Earth Sciences](https://earthsciences.anu.edu.au/) in
Canberra. Mark your diaries for **Tuesday 18/11/25 (9 am – 5 pm)**. We welcome all
participants, including existing and prospective users, developers, and collaborators.

The workshop will provide an opportunity for the G-ADOPT team to showcase recent
development and advances on the forward and adjoint components of this finite-element
modelling platform. Key areas of focus will include:

1. Mantle and lithosphere dynamics;
2. Glacial isostatic adjustment and visco-elasticity;
3. Multi-material simulations;
4. Adjoint-based optimisation problems;
5. Groundwater dynamics.

Thanks to generous support from our partners at [AuScope](https://www.auscope.org.au/),
this workshop will be free for all students and early-career academics, provided
registration is complete before the **early-bird registration deadline of 31/07/2025**.
Student and early-career registrations after this date require a contribution of A$50.
Registration for other participants will be A$200 prior to the early-bird registration
deadline and A$250 thereafter.
