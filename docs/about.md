G-ADOPT is currently underpinned by three state-of-the-art software libraries:

1. [Firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/), an automated system
for solving partial differential equations using the finite element
method;
2. [dolfin-adjoint](https://github.com/dolfin-adjoint/pyadjoint), an algorithmic
differentiation framework that automatically derives the corresponding representation
of discrete adjoint equations in a form compatible with Firedrake;
3. [Rapid Optimisation Library(ROL)](https://trilinos.github.io/rol.html), a highly
efficient package enabling advanced, large-scale optimization.

Together, they constitute a high-performance geoscientific modelling framework with
forward and adjoint calculations that achieve theoretical computational efficiency.
