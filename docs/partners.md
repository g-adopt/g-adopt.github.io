# Funding and Partners

## Background

**G-ADOPT** — the *Geoscientific ADjoint Optimisation PlaTform* — was launched under the [Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) 2020 Platforms Program](https://doi.org/10.47486/PL031), an initiative designed to transform the way research is conducted across disciplines through world-class digital research infrastructure.

Originally conceived as the **Geodynamic ADjoint Optimisation PlaTform**, G-ADOPT has since expanded beyond its initial focus on mantle convection and plate dynamics to support a wide range of geoscientific applications. These now include **groundwater simulation**, and **Earth’s response to melting polar ice sheets**.

In 2023, the platform received additional support from **AuScope**, under the **NCRIS Research Infrastructure Investment Plan (RIIP)**, to accelerate development of G-ADOPT’s capabilities for modelling glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) and related solid Earth processes — areas critical to understanding sea-level change and Earth system evolution.

The consequences of changes in the Antarctic, including sea-level rise, extreme weather events, alterations to rainfall patterns, and fisheries impacts, will be profoundly costly to Australia. However, the speed and scale of future change remains poorly understood. The Australian Centre of Excellence in Antarctic Sciences (ACEAS) will combine new field data with innovative models to revolutionise predictions of the future of the East Antarctic and Southern Ocean.
