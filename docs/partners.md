# Funding and Partners

## Background
G-ADOPT was initiated and funded within the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) [2020 platforms program](https://doi.org/10.47486/PL031), which invested in platforms that would transform the way research is conducted in various disciplines. G-ADOPT is short for ‘Geoscientific ADjoint Optimization PlaTform’. At first, though, the ‘G’ stood for ‘Geodynamic’ when the platform had a tighter focus. G-ADOPT is now applied across many branches of geosciences, including groundwater simulation, optimisation for renewable energy generation, and Earth's response to melting polar ice sheets. In 2023, the platform received funding from AuScope to focus, in particular, on the latter challenge.

The consequences of changes in the Antarctic, including sea-level rise, extreme weather events, alterations to rainfall patterns, and fisheries impacts, will be profoundly costly to Australia. However, the speed and scale of future change remains poorly understood. The Australian Centre of Excellence in Antarctic Sciences (ACEAS) will combine new field data with innovative models to revolutionise predictions of the future of the East Antarctic and Southern Ocean.
