**The Geoscientific Adjoint Optimisation PlaTform (G-ADOPT)** is a computational platform for simulating geoscientific flows, being developed and maintained by researchers from the [Research School of Earth Sciences](https://earthsciences.anu.edu.au/) at the [Australian National University (ANU)](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

Building on the concepts of composable abstraction and automatic code generation techniques, G-ADOPT aims to provide accurate, efficient, flexible, easily extensible, scalable, transparent, and reproducible open-source research software for (forward and inverse) data-driven geoscientific simulations.  

Current application areas include geodynamics, glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), groundwater and renewable energy optimisation.

Thermal structure predicted from a global mantle convection simulation in G-ADOPT, where the geographic distribution of heterogeneity is dictated by 230 Myr of imposed plate motion history from [GPlates](https://www.gplates.org/). Each image includes a radial surface immediately above the core-mantle boundary, a cross-section, and transparent isosurfaces at temperature anomalies (i.e. away from the radial average) of T=-0.075 (blue) and T=0.075 (red), highlighting the location of downwelling slabs and upwelling mantle plumes, respectively. Continental boundaries provide geographic reference. The animation provides an Africa-centered view.
