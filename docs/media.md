# Media and Outreach

G-ADOPT continues to attract attention across the research and data-science communities for its role in advancing large-scale, open, and collaborative geoscientific modelling.
Below are recent features and articles that highlight the platform’s innovation and impact.

- **EGU Geodynamics Blog** — *November 2022*  
  **[A next-generation computational modelling framework for geodynamics](https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/gd/2022/11/21/g-adopt-a-next-generation-computational-modelling-framework-for-geodynamics)**  
  This article introduces the vision behind G-ADOPT — a flexible, adjoint-capable modelling framework built on Firedrake — and explores how it is reshaping geodynamics by making high-performance, data-assimilative Earth modelling accessible to a broader research community.

- **ARDC Feature Article** — *February 2024*  
  **[A versatile tool for tackling grand challenges for Earth Sciences](https://ardc.edu.au/article/versatile-modelling-tool-to-help-tackle-grand-challenges-for-earth/)**  
  The Australian Research Data Commons highlights G-ADOPT as a national capability enabling researchers to address major questions in mantle dynamics, sea-level change, and resource formation through advanced simulation and optimisation workflows.

- **AuScope Impact Story** — *August 2025*  
  **[Antarctic Impact: How digital Earth models help decode the planet’s frozen past](https://www.auscope.org.au/impact-posts/antarctic-impact-1)**  
  This feature shows how G-ADOPT’s digital Earth models are helping scientists reconstruct Antarctica’s glacial history and understand the deep-Earth processes driving planetary change.
