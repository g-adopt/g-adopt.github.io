# Mantle convection

The diagram below illustrates the set of notebook tutorials available
in G-ADOPT and how they relate to each other. These notebooks demonstrate
how to use G-ADOPT to set up (forward and inverse) geodynamical simulations.

We start with the most basic problem — isoviscous, incompressible
convection, in an enclosed 2-D Cartesian box (base) — and
systematically build complexity, initially moving into more realistic
physical approximations (compressibility — ALA, TALA; visco-plastic
rheology), subsequently to multi-material simulations, and finally to
different dimensions and to spherical shell geometries that are more
representative of Earth's mantle.
