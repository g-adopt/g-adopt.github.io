# Tutorials

These pages are all rendered from Jupyter notebooks included in the
G-ADOPT source code. You can find them under the directory `demos/`.

To run these notebooks, you will need a working installation of
Firedrake and G-ADOPT and a Jupyter kernel for Firedrake. See the
[install page](../install.md) for instructions.

Note that Firedrake includes its own tutorials to get you started. If
you are not familiar with Firedrake, we strongly recommend that you
start with their [introductory tutorials](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/documentation.html).
