# Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA)

**From simple box models to full Earth simulations - learn how to simulate GIA step by step.**

The diagram below shows the suite of G-ADOPT notebook tutorials for simulating
Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), and how they build on one another. Together, these
tutorials demonstrate how to set up and run both forward and inverse
simulations using G-ADOPT. At present, they are focussed on simulating
viscoelastic Earth deformation under evolving surface loads. This page will be updated as
new functionality becomes available.

Our tutorials guide you from the simplest configurations to advanced, Earth-like simulations.
You'll start with a basic 2D Maxwell model, then introduce more representative physics and
geometries. Along the way, you'll learn how to analyse key model diagnostics and how to use
G-ADOPT's adjoint tools to recover unknown ice histories and/or Earth structure.

After completing these tutorials, you will be equipped to:

1. Build forward models of viscoelastic defromation driven by surface loads - from simple boxes to full spherical shells.
2. Incorporate different physics such as compressibility and a transient rheology.
3. Apply adjoint methods to invert for unknown ice histories and rheological structure.

Whether you're new to GIA or ready to tackle state-of-the-art research problems,
these tutorials provide a clear, step-by-step path into GIA modelling with G-ADOPT.
